Introducing Variables
---------------------
- Variables are containers
    - Stores different types of data

    - Godot comes with its own built-in variables
        - e.g. rotation_degrees, position, scale


To create a new variable in GDScript
------------------------------------
- Use the keyword "var" then by an identifier
    - Followed by an "=" operator & an assigned value on the same line
    - Or assign a value to the identifier on a separate line


Syntax:

var <identifier> = <value>

var <identifier>
<identifier> = value


Variable Naming Convention
--------------------------
- A variable name can NOT have spaces in-between
    - e.g. var my variable = 100

    - Use "_" to separate different words in a variable name
        e.g. var my_variable = 100


To Demonstrate
--------------
- On the "Scene" tree
    - Select the "CharacterBody2D" node


- On the "Inspector"
    - Scroll down until the "Script" field
        - Click the drop-down arrow
        - Click the menu item "New Script..."
        - Launches the "Attach Node Script" window
        
    - On the window's "Template" field
        - Click the drop-down arrow
        - Clich the menu item "Node: Default"
    
    - Click the button "Create"
        - Launches the "Script Editor" window


- On the "Script Editor"
    - On the func _ready()
        - Remove the pre-generated line of code

    - Declare a variable with the name of "score"
        - Assign the initial value of 200

    - On a separate line
        - Print the content of the variable "score" 
            - Passing the variable as argument to the function print()

    - Save the changes
        - Run the current Scene

        - On the "Output" panel
            - The value of the variable score is printed


Variable Data Types
-------------------
- Commonly used variable data types
    - String (String)
        - Group of text surrounded by a pair of ""

    - Integers (int)
        - Whole numbers

    - Floats (float)
        - Decimal numbers

    - Booleans (bool)
        - Two values only, either "true" or "false"


Type Annotation
---------------
- A variable can be specified with a type during its creation
    - Add a ":" after the variable name (identifier)
        - Then declare the data type of the value (e.g. string, boolean, etc.)
        - Followed by the "=" operator and the corresponding value
        - e.g. var my_variable: int = 100, var username: string = "Bob"

    - This prevents from accidentally assigning a different data type
        - To a variable througout the execution of the script
        - Doing so, Godot will flag an error

    - NOTE: When unsure of the approprite keyword for the data type
        - Type the first two (2) letters
        - Then auto-complete will pop-up & provide a hint


Syntax:

var <identifier>: <data_type> = <value>
