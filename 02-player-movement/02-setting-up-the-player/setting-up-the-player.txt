Setting Up The Player
---------------------
- This lecture focuses on 
    - Setting up a scene for the player character using a few nodes


To Create a Player Character
----------------------------
- Create a new Scene that will ONLY contain the player character
    - On the "Scene" tab
        - Click the button "Other Node"
    
    - Opens the floating "Create New Node" window
        - Loads all of Godot's node types
            - Blue  = 2D Game nodes
            - Green = User Interface (e.g. button, text)
            - Red   = 3D Game nodes
            - White = 

                - Blue color    = 2D game nodes
                - Green color   = User Interface (e.g. button, text)
                - Red color     = 3D game nodes
                - White color   = For everthing else (i.e. general purpose)

    - Expand "CollisionObject2D"

    - Expand "PhysicsBody2D"

    - Select-click "CharacterBody2D"
        - This contains a lot of things inside that 
            - Make is very useful as a player character
    
        - Click button "Create"
    
    - A new "CharacterBody2D" node is added on the "Scene" tab
        - NOTE: A warning "Node configuration warning" is triggered
            - Due to the absence of a "CollisionShape2D"

        - The "CollisionShape2D" node 
            - Determines the shape of the player character
            - It is also used to detect if a player character collides into something in the game
            - It shows the area where collisions could happen

    - Right-click on "CharacterBody2D"
        - Select the menu item "Add Child Node..."
        - Opens the floating "Create New Node" window
        - On the "Search" field, type "CollisionShape2D"
        - Click the button "Create"

    - A new "CollisionShape2D" is added as a child of the "CharacterBody2D" node
        - NOTE: A warning "Node configuration warning" is triggered
            - Due to the absence of a shape for the "CollisionShape2D" node

    - To define / select a shape for the "CollisionShape2D" node
        - Look at the "Inspector" tab

        - On the field "Shape"
            - Click the drop-down menu
            - Choose the corresponding shape options

        - For the player character
            - Choose the "New CapsuleShape2D" menu item

        - A tiny capsule shape appears in the viewport
            - The Orange dots can be used to adjust the radius & height of the shape

            - Alternatively, on the "Inspector" tab
                - Click the field "Shape"
                - Adjust values of the fields "Radius" & "Height"
    

- To add a sprite to the "CollisionShape2D"
    - On the "FileSystem" tree
        - Open the asset sub-folder "Actor"
        - Open the folder "Characters"
        - Open the folder "CaveLion"

        - On the "Inspector" tab
            - Expand the "Transform" tab

    - Shape it roughly equal to the size of the character

    - Aim to make it smaller than the character image

    - To move the "CapsuleShape2D" to the foreground of the viewport
        - On the "Scene" tree
        - Move the "CollisionShape2D" node on below of the "Item" node
