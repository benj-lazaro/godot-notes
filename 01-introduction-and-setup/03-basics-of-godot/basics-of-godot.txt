What are Nodes and Scenes
-------------------------
- Nodes
    - Are the building blocks in Godot
    
    - Everything that is going to be created
        - Is built out of nodes

    - There are different types of nodes
        - Each type does a specific thing (function)
        - e.g. a player's image, a sound effect, a text on screen


- Scenes
    - Are a collection of nodes
    - e.g. a player character, a game level 


To create a new 2D Scene
------------------------
- On the Scene Tree
    - Click the button "2D Scene"

    - A new node named "Node2D" is created
        - This serves as a base for the created scene

        - This 1st node is referred as the "Root Node"
            - New nodes can be added into this node


To add a new node in the Root Node
----------------------------------
- Add Godot's icon (icon.svg) into the Root Node

    - On the FileSystem
        - Click and drag the file "icon.svg" into Godot's viewport (center screen)

    - On the viewport
        - The icon is added 

    - On the Scene Tree
        - A new node named "Icon" is created

    - Add two more of the same "icon.svg" into the viewport
        - Resulting to two more nodes added into the Scene Tree
        - Each named "Icon2" and "Icon3" respectively


- Clicking any of the Icon node in the Scene Tree
    - The corresponding icon in the viewport is highlighted

    - Hovering the mouse cursor over a node
        - Displays the node type (e.g. Sprite2D)
        
        - NOTE: A "Sprite2D" is a node that shows an image in the game
