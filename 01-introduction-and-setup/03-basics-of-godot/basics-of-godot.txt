Basics Of Godot
---------------
- A quick look into Godot's interface
    - Godot's Toolbar (top middle)
        - 2D        = Opens the Viewport for 2D game development
        - 3D        = Opens the Viewport for 3D game development
        - Script    = Opens the script editor for programming

What Is A Node And A Scene
--------------------------
- A Node is a building block in Godot
    - Almost everything created in Godot is built out of Nodes 

    - There are different Node types
        - Each type with a specific function
        - e.g. shows a player's image, plays a sound effect, shows text on a screen


- A Scene is a collection of Nodes that are grouped together
    - e.g. a player character, a game level


To Create A 2D Scene
--------------------
- On the Scene Tree panel's "Create Root Node"
    - Click the button "2D Scene"
    
    - This creates a simple Node named "Node2D"
        - This serves as the base Node for the Scene

    - NOTE: The Node is also referred as the "Root Node"
        - Due to being the first Node created in the Scene


To Add A New Node Inside The Root Node
--------------------------------------
- On the FileSystem panel
    - Click the file "icon.svg"

    - Hold the left-mouse button down
        - Drag the file to the Viewport
        - Release the mouse button

    - The file "icon.svg" is added to the Viewport


- On the Scene Tree panel
        - A new Node named "Icon" is created

        - Hovering the mouse pointer over the Node
            - Identifies as a "Sprite2D" type

        - This Node type shows an image in a game
        

- For this lesson
    - Add two more "Sprite2D" Nodes in the Viewport

    - Repeat the previous steps
        - Add the same file "icon.svg" in the Viewport

    - On the Scene Tree panel
        - Added two "Sprite2D" Nodes are
        - Automatically named as "Icon2" and "Icon3", respectively

    - Clicking any of the three "Sprite2D" Nodes in the Scene Tree panel
        - The corresponding Node is highlighted in the Viewport

        - Denoted by the Red colored border
            - Surrounded with dots around it


To Rename A Node In The Scene Panel
-----------------------------------
- On the Scene Tree panel
    - Click on the targeted "Sprite2D" Node
    - Press F2
    - Type the new name of the Node
    - Press ENTER to save the changes


- For this lesson
    - Click on the Root Node named "Node2D"
        - Press F2
        - Rename to "Level1"
        - Press ENTER

    - Click on the Node named "Icon"
        - Press F2
        - Rename to "MySprite"
        - Press EENTER


To Save The Current Scene
-------------------------
- Press CTRL + s
    - Opens the window "Save Scene As..."

    - On the field "File:"
        - Type the name of the Scene
        - NOTE: By default, it has the filename extension of ".tscn"

    - Click the button "Save"
        - Alternatively, press ENTER

    - On the FileSystem panel
        - The Scene will be added


- For this lesson
    - Press CTRL + s

    - On the field "File:"
        - Type "level1.tscn"
    
    - Click on the button "Save"
    
    - On the FileSystem panel
        - The Scene named "level1.tscn" is added

    - Close the Scene
        - Clicking the "X" of the Viewport


To Open A Closed Scene
----------------------
- On the FileSystem panel
    - Double click a Scene 

    - Loads the Scene in the Viewport


- For this lesson
    - On the FileSystem panel
        - Double-click the Scene "level1.tscn"
        - Loads the Scene in the Viewport
    

To Move A Node Inside A Scene
-----------------------------
- Godot has a set of tools located on the Viewport panel's top-left corner
    - Specifically the first four (4) buttons

    - Select Mode (press "Q")
        - Enables the ability to select a Node in a Scene 

        - A selected Node in the Viewport
            - Denoted by the Red colored border
            - Surrounded with dots around it
        
        - These dots surrounding the Node
            - Allows it to be stretched, scaled or skewed

    - Move Node (press "W")
        - Enables the ability to move a selected Node anywhere in a Scene

        - Inside the selected Node
            - Show two (2) arrows
                - Red   = moves the Node left or right of a Scene
                - Green = moves the Node up or downn of a Scene

    - Rotate Node (press "E")
        - Enables the ability to rotate a selected Node in a Scene


    - Scale Node (press "S")
        - Enables the ability to scale a selected Node in any direction

        - To proportionally scale a Node
            - Hold down SHIFT
            - While dragging the mouse pointer


    - NOTE: To undo any recent actions
        - Press CTRL + Z
