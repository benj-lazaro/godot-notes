Basics of Godot
---------------
- Focuses on Godot's user interface
    - Top middle toolbar
        - 2D        = switches the viewport to the 2d part of the game
        - 3D        = switches the viewport to the 3d part of the game
        - Script    = built-in code editor for writing game scripts
        - Game      = <to be discussed on the next lecture>
        - AssetLib  = download game assets and extensions 

    - Lower left (FileSystem)
        - Displays the current files in the project

        - NOTE: The icon.svg (i.e. Godot icon) is automatically generated
            - Whenever a new Godot project is created

    - Top left (Scene Tree)
        - Displays all nodes in a scene

    - Right (Inpector | Node | History)
        - Inspector (default) view & change details 
            - Of a selected node in the viewport


What are Nodes & Scenes
-----------------------
- Nodes are the building block in Godot
    - Almost everthing to be created in Godot is built of out nodes 
    
    - There are different types of nodes
        - Each with does a specific thing (function)
        - e.g. shows an image of a player, plays a sound effect, renders screen text


- A Scene is a collection of nodes grouped together
    - e.g. player character, a game level


To create a 2D Scene
--------------------
- On the Scene Tree
    - Under the label "Create Root Node"
    
    - Click the button "2D Scene"
        - Adds a simple 2D node named "Node2D"
        - This serves as a base for the current scene

    - This first node is called the "Root Node"
        - New (succeeding) nodes can be added inside


Adding a new node inside the Root Node
--------------------------------------
- On the FileSystem
    - Click & hold the file "icon.svg"
        - Drag the file into the viewport (i.e. center screen)
        - Release the mouse
    
    - On the viewport
        - The "icon.svg" file is added on the viewport

    - On the Scene Tree
        - A node named "Icon" is added

    - Draggin the same "icon.svg" file from the FileSystem into the viewport
        - Adds 2 more nodes into the Scene Tree
        - Each respectively named "Icon2" & "Icon3"

    - Clicking any of dnoes in the Scene Tree
        - Gets highlighted in the viewport

    - Hovering the mouse over a node in the Scene Tree
        - Shows that it is a "Sprite2D" node type
        
        - NOTE: A "Sprite2D" node shows an image in the game

  
Renaming a node in the Scene Tree
---------------------------------
- On the Scene Tree
    - Click on the targeted node
    - Press F2
    - Type the new name of the node
    - Press ENTER to save changes


Saving the current scene
------------------------
- Press CTRL + S
    - Launches a new window "Save Scene As..."

    - On the field "File:"
        - Type the name of the scene
        - NOTE: A scene has the filename extension of ".tscn"

    - Click the button "Save
        - Alternatively, press ENTER


Loading a save scene
--------------------
- On the FileSystem
    - Double-click the scene to be loaded into the viewport


Moving a node inside a scene
----------------------------
- Use the left-most four (4) viewport toolbar buttons 
    - Select Mode (Q)
        - Selects a node in a scene 

        - Clicking a node in the viewport
            - Displays a number of poins around a node
            - Can be used to stretch / skew a node


    - Move Mode (W)
        - Moves a selected node anywhere the scene

        - Shows two (2) arrows inside the selected node
            - Red arrow     = moves the node left or right
            - Green arrow   = moves the node up or down


    - Rotate Mode (E)
        - Rotates a selected node 


    - Scale Mode (S)
        - Scales a selected node up or down

        - NOTE: To scale proportionally
            - Hold-down the SHIFT button

    - NOTE: To undo recent actions, press CTRL + Z


Practice
---------
    - Press "Q" or click "Select Mode" from the viewport's toolbar
        - Click on the targeted node in the viewport

    - On the Inspector
        - Expand the drop-down menu "Transform"

        - The section "Postion"
            - Moves the selected node in the viewport

            - To move up    = decrease the value of "y"
            - To move down  = increase the value of "y"
            - To move left  = decrease the value of "x"
            - To move right = increase the value of "x"

        - The section "Rotation"
            - Rotates the selecte node

            - To rotate clockwise           = move the slider to the right
            - To rotate counterclockwise    = move the slider to the left

        - The section "Scale"
            - Increases or decreases the size of the selected node

            - NOTE: By default, a node is assigned with the value of "1"
                - On both "x" and "y" axis

        - The section "Skew"
            - Skews the selected node in a specific direction
                - Offers neat effects
                - But NOT quote useful in most cases


Running the project (game)
--------------------------
- On the toolbar right above the Inspector
    - Run Project (F5)
        - This executes the ENTIRE project (game)

        - Launches a new window
            - Loads the game

    - Run Current Scene (F6)
        - This executes the loaded scene
            - NOT the entire project (game)

        - Launches a new window
            - Loads the current scene

    - NOTE: Both execution launches the Output window
        - Located at the bottom of the viewport
        - Provides information about the about the running project

    - NOTE: The viewport has a Blue/Purple colored border
        - This function as a boundary or the screen of the game

        - This show the boundaries of a game's actual viewable screen


Close a running project (game)
-------------------------------
- Click Stop Running Project (F8)
    - Alternatively, close the project window


Removing a node from the Scene Tree
-----------------------------------
- On the Scene Tree
    - Click the targeted node

    - Press DELETE
        - Launches a confirmation window
        - Click on the button "OK"
